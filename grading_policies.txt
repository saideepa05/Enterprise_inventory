ENTERPRISE DIAMOND GRADING & INVENTORY POLICIES

1. Overview
This document outlines the standard operating procedures for the Enterprise Diamond Inventory system.

2. Carat Weight Policy
Diamonds are categorized by carat weight:
- Small: Under 0.5 carats.
- Medium: 0.5 to 1.5 carats.
- Large: 1.5 to 3.0 carats.
- Premium: Exposure Above 3.0 carats.

3. Cut Quality Standards
We recognize five cut grades: Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal. 
Our high-end collections must only include 'Ideal' or 'Premium' cut diamonds.

4. Color Grading
We follow the standard D (colorless) to J (near colorless) scale.
Colorless diamonds (D, E, F) are considered high-tier.
Near colorless diamonds (G, H, I, J) are considered mid-tier.

5. Pricing and Discount Policy
- Any diamond with a price exceeding $15,000 requires manager approval for sale.
- Seasonal discounts of 10% apply to diamonds in the 'Fair' cut category during the month of June.
- New arrivals (stocked in the last 30 days) are not eligible for discounts.

6. Return Policy
Customers may return diamonds within 30 days of purchase, provided the original certification and receipt are presented. A 5% restocking fee applies to all returns of 'Premium' or 'Ideal' cut diamonds.

7. Inventory Audits
Physical inventory audits are conducted quarterly. Any discrepancy in 'carat' weight exceeding 0.05 carats must be reported to the security department immediately.
